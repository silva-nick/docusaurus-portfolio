## Docusaurus Portfolio Theme

This package contains the React components that serve as the frontend for `docusaurus-portfolio`.

---

#### Installation:

```sh
yarn add docusaurus-portfolio-theme
```

**Note:** this plugin will currently not function without also installing and configuring its brother package, `docusaurus-portfolio-plugin`.

#### Configuration:

To configure the plugin, add or update your configuration options in `docusaurus.config.json`.

```javascript
    themes: ['docusaurus-portfolio-theme'],
```

**Notice:** A lot of this code should be refactored to work better with Infima styling. Also, this package can and should be combined with the plugin.
